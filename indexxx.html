They all feel very nice and it's sweet to have some company, even if only remotley. Maybe the fact that it's remotely makes it even easier. Some wrote about interesting spawning grounds around the Bay, and I'll go ahead and sum up that information so I can adapt my route accordingly -></div>

                        <div class="card-body">My thoughts at the end of the first day are, that there are moments when it actually feels like a little Pokémon adventure travel. When I approached the Redwood City Harbor area this evening, biking on that long path, the sun setting on my left and the large buildings shining green, I did feel like I imagine feeling in the game, approaching a new City. And man: I made it. I biked from one city on my map to the next one ; ) Wasn't necessarily the plan, but hei! it's cool with me.</div>

                    <div class="card">
                        
                        <div class="card-body">Another thought is, that catching Pokémon doesn't work very well like that. I mean, completing the Pokédex, getting many, getting specific ones, etc. The whole catching business. Because it still takes pretty long to get from one place to another, it's still hard to find specific mons with the three-steps around and Pokévision simply not showing many or any.</div>

                </div>

                    <div class="card">
                        
                        <div class="card-body">So, primarily, it is a travel. And only secondarily it is a travel to catch Pokémon. It is still very integrated, the whole Go experience. I have the app running all the time and I check frequently. I have those people I am chatting with, and we talk about Pokémon. And I try (but didn't manage well) to utilize these other apps, to try to pinpoint where one really is and maybe end up finding interesting ones.</div>

                        <div class="card-body">So I biked. The sun was sweet and set during the evening for a very long time. Some special flowers were in bloom that gave off a very distinct smell that lingered in the air, together with cut grass. It might have been wild fennel, but really tall plants. People were walking in bunches in the evening, around the park, together, small kids with bikes, couples, and people alone were running. I wonder how is it possible that Americans are fat - they have going for a walk outside so established as a together-activity! I passed by some people talking about hatching eggs, and I find it really beautiful how pervasive the game is. That is one reason why I wanted to go on this trip. To look around and see it popping up here and there. It's making a real difference in people's lives. Suddenly people walk. Someone told me that he walked 40 miles in the past week! A week ago or so I heard some people saying "Obama tries to do away with obesity, and then Pokémon Go comes out and it just solves within a few days..." It's obviously overdone, but it's not so far from the truth. I believe it is a very nice example of positive influence.</div>

                        <div class="card-body">Also the groups formed, young kids together with their friends together with their older brother and their friends. Little groups walking around together catching Pokémon. Outside. Awesome! And families together. Parents playing with their kids. And couples taking walks. And also people alone. Middle aged men, women, young boys in two, girl groups... everyone is playing! It's quite impressive, it is.</div>

                        <div class="card-body">Another thing I want to note, is that hatching works pretty well. Catching not really, but hatching does. I hatched today already 5 Pokémon on the first day of the trip. While most of them weren't too interesting, one was actually a Scyther. Yay! : ) I bike slowly, and the game counts my steps, or most of it at least. So eggies hatch. It's cool! Except that now I only have one incubator, so it'll slow down considerably. But okay. I have many more miles to roll!</div>
