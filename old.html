				Pokémon GO has bedazzled me : ) I didn't know anything about this coming, and the first weekend I returned from a hiking trip to Stanford campus, I saw a lot of people walking around with their mobile phones. Initially I thought that it's something to get to know the campus for new students. It took me two days to figure out that it wasn't.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was something else. Something new.
			</p>
			<p>
				And it made people go out in small groups at night. They talked, they walked, and they had fun.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was interesting.
			</p>
			<p>
				So I wanted to know more. And after playing a bit, I decided to go on an adventure - in good old Pokémon style...

				<p class="note">
					I'm sitting next to the wide salt marshes off Redwood City, behind some oleander bushes that separate me from the road. It's night, both on my phone as well as outside, and I decided to try to record a bit my thoughts and experiences on this pokétravel.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					First of all: It's quite fun! :) I'm just going on a bike ride, but there's this additional level to it, some small task that is constantly there if I want to have it. If I don't want to, and rather just look at the passing landscape, it's pretty easy to turn it off.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I started late, because the GoPro I bought through craigslist a few days ago was making troubles. I'm not too lucky with the action cameras so far... I read up on the issue and realized it might be related to a bad SD card. After a short down time that had followed my excitement of "starting early in the morning", and earning $55 online as a distraction, I decided to start anyways.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					My first stop brought me to Fry's Electronics, a huge store in Palo Alto that sells all sorts of electronic equipment. I decided to go get a proper SD card and assume that the camera was fine and didnt freeze because of bigger problems. Got one after careful consideration, and even a 53Cents iPhone 4 screen protector for my iPhone 5C. It snugly fits, leaving the top free and framing the time with the loudspeaker cutout : )
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					So what's there to say. Mostly it's not too interesting to read these journals afterwards, or for someone else, so I'll try to think about what were the interesting things for me, actually.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Recently I found out why thee are these people sitting all day (and night) at the train crossings... <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/12/the-silicon-valley-suicides/413140/"><strong>Suicides...</strong></a>
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I enjoy being part of the Pokémon Go whatsapp group of those SF people. They all feel very nice and it's sweet to have some company, even if only remotley like that. Maybe that's also easier, to have it only remotely like that. They've also already told me quite a lot about interesting spawning grounds, and I'll go ahead and collect that information so I can adapt my route accordingly.

					My thoughts at the end of the first day are, that there are moments when it actually feels like a little Pokémon adventure travel. When I approached the Redwood City Harbor area this evening, biking on that long path, the sun setting on my left and the large buildings shining green, I did feel like I imagine feeling in the game, approaching a new City.
					And man: I made it. I biked from one city on my map to the next one ; ) Wasn't necessarily the plan, but hei! it's cool with me.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Another thought is, that catching Pokémon doesn't work very well like that. I mean, completing the Pokédex, getting many, getting specific ones, etc. The whole catching business. Because it still takes pretty long to get from one place to another, it's still hard to find specific mons with the three-steps around and Pokévision simply not showing many or any.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					So, primarily, it is a <strong>travel</strong>. And only secondarily it is a travel to catch Pokémon. It is still very integrated, the whole Go experience. I have the app running all the time and I check frequently. I have those people I am chatting with, and we talk about Pokémon. And I try (but didn't manage well) to utilize these other apps, to try to pinpoint where one really is and maybe end up finding interesting ones.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					So I biked. The sun was sweet and set during the evening for a very long time.
					Some special flowers were in bloom that gave off a very distinct smell that lingered in the air, together with cut grass. It might have been wild fennel, but really tall plants. People were walking in bunches in the evening, around the park, together, small kids with bikes, couples, and people alone were running. I wonder how is it possible that Americans are fat - they have going for a walk outside so established as a together-activity! I passed by some people talking about hatching eggs, and I find it really beautiful how pervasive the game is. That is one reason why I wanted to go on this trip. To look around and see it popping up here and there. It's making a real difference in people's lives. Suddenly people walk. One guy in the whatsapp group wrote today that he walked 40 miles in the past week.
					A week ago or so I heard some people saying "Obama tries to do away with obesity, and then Pokémon Go comes out and it just solves within a few days..." It's obviously overdone, but it's not so far from the truth. I believe it is a very nice example of positive influence.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Also the groups formed, young kids together with their friends together with their older brother and their friends. Little groups walking around together catching Pokémon. Outside. Awesome!
					And families together. Parents playing with their kids.
					And couples taking walks. And also people alone. Middle aged men, women, young boys in two, girl groups... everyone is playing! It's quite impressive, it is.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Okay, just some thoughts...
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Another thing I want to note, is that hatching works pretty well. Catching not really, but hatching does. I hatched today already 5 Pokémon on the first day of the trip. While most of them weren't too interesting, one was actually a Scyther. Yay! : )
					I bike slowly, and the game counts my steps, or most of it at least. So eggies hatch. It's cool! Except that now I only have one incubator, so it'll slow down considerably.
					But okay. I have many more miles to roll!
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Day 1. Pretty views. An Evee at the Oval. A Slowbro around Facebook. The smell of wild Fennel. White crusts on the salt marshes. Normal outdoor Americans. The road to Redwood City Harbor. My sitting spot my sleeping spot. A skunk that just walks by. Planes flying, sky graying, trains honking, loading stones. Me here, finally out. Finally moving, and on the road again. My bike my helmet my sleeping bag and me.
					Time to say good night.
					Good night. : )

			<h3>Day 2 - Redwood City ~~~ Pacifica</h3>
			<img class="banner" src="img/RC_marina.jpg">
			<section class="thoughts">
				<p class="note">
					Started to experience that it can be quite fun to gym-battle against someone. You don't usually know who it is. Or if it's the same person. Or even how many. It feels as if there is this one foe, and you battle and try. Finally you win the gym, then you lose it again. And this can go over and over again. <br>But maybe it's a bunch of different people. Every time someone new. In the end it doesn't matter. You have this tiny competition going, and after all it's just about picking up those 10 gold coins every day. But hei: Today I got 20! Boosted two of my stronger Pokemon and took two gyms that were close to each other. Then be fast: <br>Collect. <br>Yay.
				</p>
				<div class="note">
					<img class="phone-screenshot" src="img/two_gyms.jpg">
				</div>
				<p class="note">
					There's this thing about Pokémon, that was also in a way present in the Gamboy games - that there are these few strong ones that it makes sense to have and train (or feed, in the GO case), and therefore it ends up being a rather boring selection of always the same Pokémon hovering around the gym towers.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Today I also started using the Pokéradar - in order to then walk and look for a specific mon. It was fun! I got a Kabuto like that, and the funnest part was pedaliung fast towards a Kingler... I knew my chances to be there on time were slim, and indeed it had vanished before I arrived. Hm... I was thinking that this travel is so far a very slow one, and maybe it <strong>is</strong> actually a Pokémon travel : )
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I had an intense battle with a Butterfree in front of the Oracle fountain (and the hovering Katamaran). Butterfree had 500something CP and was very stubborn about going to live inside a ball. I offered him loads of them. Different ones. Re-white ones, blue-red ones, and even quite a bunch of black-yellow ones! He checked a few of them out from the inside, but declined every time. In the end I ran out of offers and he just disappeard. Belly full of Razzberries. <br>There is no such thing as a free Butterfree.

					<- Consequences of overspending...
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					A stopover in a Starbucks brought me to witness the little circle of old men meeting there. Wehen one plus arrived I tried to make space, and so we got to talk a bit. Turns out three of five spoke German. Before I left I got a Starbucks gift card from one of the men... "So that you remember this place". I do.
				</p>
				<img class="note" src="">
				<p class="note">
					Up on one Vista Point.
					<br>San Francisco in the distance.
					<br>I trained one Pidgeot-held gym up to Lv 3. I then assign a mon before I leaving, and learned that this counts towards the rewards pickup.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					It's funny how I expect everyone I see with a phone to be playing too. A guy in a white car looked at me suspiciously, and I thought "aha!".
					<br>A little later I saw him inhaling drugs from a balloon.
					<br>I guess not everyone is actually playing. : /
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Another thing about this place here, and I feel like generalizing it to "US-Americans", is that people enjoy their Vista Points from within their cars.
					<br>Come, park, watch, (inhale,) drive forward.
					<br>More people came, but only two older ladies ever left their car.
					They went to the bench and the younger helped the older one light a cigarette.
					<br>Inhale.
					<br>Drive forward.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I went astray. Up towards the water reservoirs - and back down without ever getting there. Didn't really take care for directions and ended up doing a hilly-loop drive. I don't mind. It was good and completely worth it!
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Worth it because I found the Guittard chocolate factory in Milbrae. I found it in the best possible way: smelling the chocolate being made, tasting it out of the air! I love it when such good smells linger suspended, and it makes me unsure where the borders lie between tasting and smelling.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					The Guittard chocolate factory does not, so I found out, sell chunks of broken chocolate at the factory. <!-- I guess it all goes to MilkPail... : ) --> But the ladies were friendly and when she asked me what darkness of chocolate I like, I realized that I won't be leaving with empty hands after all.
					<br>I like it dark.

					Cute! Some old roads, from when i first arrived... A same view, but coming from the other side. I biked up to the second reservoir.
					<br>Memories of getting my first Clif bar as a present from a friendly ranger :D
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					It was pretty intense to see how the world suddenly plunged from hot and dry and sunny, into cold and wet and foggy. Without much movement or time change. The clouds I would often see plunging across the hills towards the Bay in the evening. Today I was within them. Winds blow strongly, an unknown wetness sweeps through your hair, and the sunshine hides away behind layers of suspended waterdrops.

			<h3>Day 3 - Pacifica Galore</h3>
			<img class="banner" src="img/mori_point_whales.jpg">
			<section class="thoughts">
				<p class="note">
					<strong>Whales!</strong> I was sitting at Pacifica pier eating my breakfast, when a jogging lady asked me whether I had seen the whale. :o
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					And then we watched into the foggy sea for a while... Birds went for my food and distracted me for a moment. Just the moment when he had surfaced the next time!
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					But I kept watching, and she told me where to look. I had never seen a whale before! ... And then, suddenly: a fountain in the middle of the sea. A sigh of exhale that sprays the drops up to the sky. And a tiny distant black cutting through the surface.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					It was gone very fast, and already too far to be in sight the next time it would surface. And I saw it!
					<br>: D
					<br><em>Didn't catch it, though ; )</em>
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Pacifica pier is a crazy spawning ground. I rushed from one side to the other, and out onto the pier, drawing looks from fishermen. Haha, we're doing the same pretty much! Getting up early to catch some. I wonder how many play GO. The pier surely is a good place for it.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I might have to change my approach in noting the catches. Because now there are so many! I've caught Oddishes, a Seel, a Starmie, two Rapidash, a Voltorb, a Geodude, a Bellsprout, a Horsea, a Gastly, an Exeggcute, numerous Poliwags, and (both first time!): a Psyduck and a Goldeen, and even a Squirtle and a Charmander! And that just during maybe one hour in the morning!
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I also tried this (I just had to do it empirically...)<br>And I really wanted that Vaporeon!
				</p>
				<div class="note">
					<img src="img/gimme_vaporeon.gif">
				</div>
				<p class="note">
					Only later I learned about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/4t0cpo/psa_how_to_force_your_eevee_to_evolve_into_your/">this trick on reddit</a> to get the evolution you want. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4vslur/how_the_eevee_naming_conventions_actually_work/">There's more to it, though</a>).
					<br><br>Personally I'm a little disappointed, and would have preferred if it was depending on the surroundings, as also many of the game versions <a href="http://pokemondb.net/pokedex/eevee#dex-flavor">Pokédex entries suggest</a>.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Now I've settled in a Starbucks in one of Pacifica's beach valleys (one I like less than the one I stayed at before, which was Sharp Park). Trying to figure out how to upload my page to webhosting, so that it could go online. I decided I'll simply put it up as a work-in-progress and then come to update it when I can, not only the content but also the appearance. Most probably no one will look at it anyways, and if so, there's a story of my progress involved : )
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I biked around the Pacifica Public Pier a few times and caught a bunch of Pokémon I never even saw before, since playing GO. It was pretty neat! I also totally grew to like the foggyness of that valley, it made a special atmosphere to everything, calm and cool and beautiful. And a little bit mysterious. It's still peculiar when coming from 6 months on the other side of those small hills, where fog never stays longer than until maybe 8 in the morning.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					After deciding I'd go bike North later on (there's a PkmGo event in SF tomorrow, and I'll probably be going to another UConnect session before), I was heading South to take a closer look at the whales and charge my devices. Whales first.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					As the jogger lady had suggested, I hiked up Mori Point. ... The view was just plain amazing. Sea and crashing shores all around. And those bird flocks above the water, then a fountain, and a sight of a big black body surfacing for a moment. There are whales all around, and here you were able to see all around. I watched one of them pass from left to right, which took surprisingly long. It was calm. I quite enjoyed the sight.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I didn't do this... Poor Krabby! ->
				</p>
				<div class="note">
					<img class="photo" src="img/poor_krabby.jpg">
				</div>
				<p class="note">
					There's this inital period of trying to capture things on camera. It is a bit of a frenzy sometimes. It is probably useless, as I haven't yet established a good way of dealing with those moments I capture. But I do it still, something about life being fleeting, something about the wish to share, something about the wish to keep and remember.
					<br>But my thought today was, that once that initial craze has passed, then I am able to sit and calm down. It's a wave. And if the situation lasts long enough, and if I am consciously staying around in the situation for long enough, then I can also just sit and look... And that's just what I did.
					<br>Whales. : D
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Me not being employed in a normal job, and not extremely working on a career, does have advantages that I sometimes also feel and think about. I really like to sleep a little during the day. Naps. Naps in the sunshine, around midday, or early afternoon. It would be much more difficult to do this under different circumstances.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I lied down up there on the edge of the cliff. Sideways, so I could see the sea and the whale I had been watching, as he swam further North. The view was impressive. It was approaching noon, and the fog was still covering the sky completely. However, the sun was sending its warmth through the foggy blanket and this made it very comfortable to just lie around and doze while I looked out in the distance and then inside my brain's twirls.

			<h3>Day 4 - Pacifica to San Fran</h3>
			<img class="banner" src="img/frisko.png">
			<section class="thoughts">
				<p class="note">
					I woke up before 4am. Not a long night. I decided to start biking.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					It was extremely foggy all the way. Water hung in the air. It was dark and foggy and I must have been invisible safe for my two tiny lights. The streets were empty and I cycled along, sometimes walking. I caught a few Pokémon, marked one Magnemite nest on the PokéRadar, and had a very good time for thinking. The slow walks in the night through the invisible made some wheels turn in my head.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I looooove this smell of eucalyptus in the air!!!
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					wow.
					<br>except for my computer now, i feel like the most homeless person in the universe in this city. Seeing all these people in the streets makes me really sad. It’s pretty intense. I think my face dropped many centimeters from where I started this morning. It just all feels so messy and run down. The two smells of San Francisco again: weed and homelessness. It really doesn’t make me happy to come here. There is this moment at the beginning when it does. It did again today, it did originally when I came the first time.
					<br>But the heavy of it all sinks in and weighs me down immensely. I guess I wouldn’t want to work here. Rather from home on the countryside. Those hundreds of Pokéstops can’t make up for it, when I need to dive into spinning them so that I don’t look at the outside too much.
					<br><br>I can only imagine that one moves at a different level when you’re rich. That you’re somewhere higher up so you don’t need to see and smell all this. It makes sense that kings built their stairways above the streets, so that they could walk to church without needing to go out on the street.Or that futures often show the scum dropping to the bottom (or below) the streets.
					<br>Strange strange strange.
					<br>Maybe that event tonight is gonna be enough SF for me on this journey. I’d prefer fewer Pokémon if it means more joy in life…
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					and wow crazy... I have a website online. My own self-made website, and it’s hosted somewhere that i paid for. And it has only the URL I gave it. It’s crazy!
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I came here for two things UConnect, and later there will be the Mystery Island Event - a Pokémon Go gathering in the Fort Mason area. Many many people from around SF, also some people from the WhatsApp group. That's gonna be interesting to see, looking forward to it. Also, but I haven't researched this yet, many people playing at one spot might cause more spawns somehow?
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					A bit tired... I'll try to get a bed tonight.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					no bed, all booked. but i got myself a hot chocolate.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I've arrived at the city. The big city of this map. It's not pleasant. I feel out of place. There's a large amount of trainers around, you see everyone walking down the pathways catching and training. The city is messy. Big, too, and it feels as if it makes life hectic and difficult. This is not the way my adventure goes. However, it fits in here well. A step on the way. The big city, it is loud, people are training (but are they really?). A trainer on an adventure has to pass by these kinds of places. Because the city fame and elusive pleasures is not what he set out for. There's something else that is calling, and that something is adventure.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I came to attend this event. The big trainer gathering. I've seen them walk around the hill, hundreds it feels, and it's only getting started. I needed a time-out but I will return soon, not sure how long I'll stay. The big events are not my scene I guess, but I really wanted to see what is going on and how do people play here. It's impressive how massive the game is. It feels that everyone plays. Families do, coulples do, groups of friends do, and even some single people do. It seems to appeal to everyone, and cover all the areas of human. I felt it was big back there, but this is surprising for me. Big cities, many people. I wonder how it looks like in other countries, how it looks like at home. Because today I realized that I am attributing it to here, as a cultural phenomenon of the US - but it isn't at all. Globalization has swept across years ago, so a trend so big is never contained to one country. So the changes I experience are changes worldwide probably, and I just feel them so specific to this area, because this is where I was when the changes hit.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Ooooh... A couple next to me is speaking with sign language. It is so beautiful! Maybe I should make the effort and learn it after all.

			<h3>Day 5 - From Fort Mason all along Embarcadero</h3>
			<img class="banner" src="img/fort_mason.jpg">
			<section class="thoughts">
				<p class="note">
					Yesterday I got introduced to the Silph Road and to IVs in Go. Now I've spent the morning checking up on the Pokémon I caught and still have - and realized it makes it much more difficult to give any away (before checking). I went through a few so far, my starter Charmander that I still have was deemed ungradeable, and I didn't have any really good ones yet. Enter: another layer to the game.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					One plan I came up with yesterday night, was that I would leave SF with enough Magikarp candy, so I'd be able to evolve a Gyarados. Therefore I'll now head off for a walk along Embarcadero towards the Caltrain station.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I spend a lot of time at a Starbucks in Marina District, working on this blog and sorting through some mons. Charging for power and drinking for tea. All these things that need to be done once in a while. When I headed off, I took it slow.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Slowly biking along the Embarcadero does indeed give the chance to catch a lot of Magikarps. Also Psyducks and Tentacools. Those three are everywhere. And then there are sometimes some other, more rare ones. I collected Magikarps en masse. Time was getting close for reaching the final train and I was wondering whether I'd get enough candy to evolve - without missing the train while trying to get it.
					<br>I did. : )
					<br>Mission "SF-Gyarados" accomplished.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Night fell while I was sitting on the Caltrain driving back home, and some melancholy overcame. My avatar kept running running running... And somehow this felt very fitting. I watched, and mingled with some life-metaphors in my head.

			<h3>Day 8 - Sorting my Box, Some of the City's Parks</h3>
			<img class="banner" src="img/balcony.jpg">
			<section class="thoughts">
				<p class="note">
					So I spent the whole morning, midday and early afternoon sorting through my Pokémon box. Finally I went to check all the IVs of all the ones that I kept, in order to determine which ones to keep and which ones to evolve further. It was a ride! I worked on my system of taking notes and how to adapt the SilphRoad IV tool to give me good results. Here's the essential takeaway:

					Hatched Pokémon are usually in the second-to-best range of IVs. I've never seen one worse than that, and I've seen one that was further up in the best range.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					(personally, currently) CONFIRMED: CP does not really matter. If you're into long-term gains, then the IVs are important. You can always level up the CP of a Pokémon with Stardust and Candy (sure, some catching needs to be done for that). But you can't change the IVs. So once the Pokémon will max out, you will be left off with a better one if you chose one with great IVs.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					The best Magikarp of the lot I caught was at CP86 - It showed an overall <strong>minimun</strong> of 52% above average! The maximum betterness might go up to 62% above average.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					There's an imprecision factor in trying to determine the IVs. That factor is the level of the Pokémon, that needs to be set through adjusting a slider on an arc (just like in the game). However, it is difficult to get the exact right position for the slider, since the amount of Stardust, that can be used to double-check, is usually accurate for more than only one level. In some Pokémon and some level ranges, this potential span of differences can be very large, so that e.g. a Magikarp could be between 37% and 54% total above average. This makes a huge difference.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Because I didn't want to get disappointed later on after having invested loads of candy and stardust, I started to set the slider on the highest possible stardust level, which produces the worst possible results for that mon. Just to be on the safe side. This didn't make me have many good ones, but at least I'd be on the safe side. : )
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Another way to approximate this better, is by switching on the Developer Tools in Chrome and selecting to display the page in mobile (my phone size), which brings the arc to an easier comparison to the one displayed on the phone.
				</p>
				<div class="note">
					<img class="screenshot" src="img/dev_tool_arc.png">

				<p class="note">
					And then Chansey came along and confused my whole system with these results...
				</p>
				<div class="note">
					<img class="screenshot" src="img/chansey_the_destroyer.png">
				</div>
				<p class="note">
					However, for now I don't have a better system to check the IVs and stats, so I kept it running like I had before. But something is not working out completely well with simply adding up the percentages. Hm...
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Wrapping up, I managed to make space for ~100 new Pokémon, which I will have to fill up with Pidgeys and Caterpies in order to prepare for 30 minutes of Evolution.

					I don't know what to do about this city.<br>This San Francisco.<br>Today it was beautiful. These hills just in the middle of the city, and parks all over.

				</p>
				<p class="note">
					<strong>One big thought:</strong> I was thinking how beautiful it is that this game allows so many different aspects to explore. It makes me change game tactics, it makes me devise systems, test them, revise them. Improve my results and my experience through the systems I made up. And then... Then it also makes me go outside, walk around, test the hypotheses, discover new places and enjoy beautiful views. Get some excercise and have something to do, while standing in a beautiful spot.<br><br>
					Today I was thinking that I want to find a job that is like this. And then I was thinking, that science is actually kind of like that! : )

			<h3>Day #12 - Safari Zone</h3>
			<img class="banner" src="img/coastal_view.jpg">
			<section class="thoughts">
				<p class="note">
					I rose having slept too little. The thought of the mountain lion kept my sleep light and disrupted. At least there was the morning view, no...? Aehm... No. Haha.
					<br>Fog.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Making my way down the windy slopes to Muir Woods (Safari Zone) I felt quite excited about hiking. There wouldn't be much Pokémon catching today I realized, because I had 0 reception and the app wouldn't start up. Well well well. Bugs and troubles <em>does</em> sound like Safari Zone!
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I went to visit the Coast Redwood Trees, the tallest of their kind. Trees so huge that you can easily raise your head to remove the other tourists from sight and still keep seeing only trees. It's trees all the way up.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I like and respect this US American thing, that many people go outside into nature as their free time activity. Families do, friends go, it's really a thing much more than in other places. Even if this brings a weird bunch of people into the woods, and even if nature appreciation doesn't go much farther than the smallest loop. It's still more than other folks come up with. I really wonder how one can become fat when movement is such an essential and natural part of a culture.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Leaving the most common loop, however, leaves me pretty much alone. I've experienced this in other places as well. So that I do prefer and I can finally remove the earplugs and listen to the sounds of the woods instead of my heartbeat. I climb up higher on the nearby hills, dedicated to take a little hiking tour around Muir Woods and also the coast. I feel that I didn't sleep much the night before.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					After arriving up on the top, there's a surprise in store for me: My cell reception is back, and with it also Pokémon Go. - and, as it turns out, another new way of playing the game. Here it comes:
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Because there is only one single path here that is possible to walk, the "Nearby" feature actually makes sense and is very accurate. Checking the grid I can see which mons I'll be encountering on the way. I walk forward. At some point my phone buzzes and I know who'll be there - and indeed! It's that Pidgey I saw on the radar before. It's fun, again very different than before. There's no searching, it's simply an early warning system, and you walk on confident that it'll buzz up sooner or later.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					There was a surprising amount and diversity of Pokémon that I found up there on the ridge of the Coastal View Trail. MuirPidgey, MuirBell, MuirFairy, Krabby, Poliwag, Nidoran male, Zubat, Weedle, Evee, and even a Butterfree and a Pinsir!
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					<img src="img/pkm_sprites/pinsir.png">
					<br>Yay! That makes real Safari Zone memories rise!
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Later at the Muir Beach lookout I even found a Squirtle and a Geodude alongside some more of those I already mentioned. Logged them duly and was happy about my surprising wealth of catches for this remote area.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Being in this new area also made me play more with the AR option. Somehow it just felt fitting to take pictures of the beautiful scenery together with the Pokémon in them. Here's a little selection of my Coastal Trail / Muir Woods / Real-life Safari Zone encounters:

			<h3>Day #13 - Marin County Hangout</h3>
			<img class="banner" src="img/muir_beach.jpg">
			<section class="thoughts">
				<p class="note">
					I crossed the hills on Hwy 1, then spent most of the day in a Starbucks earning a bit of money. I had been exhausted and was considering a day at the beach, but the lack of electricity (and sunlight) led me to move on.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					So then when I biked a bit more in the evening I felt exhausted still and decided to call it a day at the edges of the Horse Hill Open Space Preserve. Looked for a spot, and followed the tracks of deer with proud antlers that I saw first looking at me in disbelief, then making way for me. This area must be quite a hangout spot for them, because large areas of the high grass are squished down to comfortable sleeping spots.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I went ahead to look for one for me as well. One thing I kept remembering from a story that a person told me about their encounter with a mountain lion, was to better not rest on the path of an animal... So I looked around, digging in a bit deeper... until I figured in cold sweat that the bush I'd been considering to dive into was poison oak. A HUGE poison oak! I had gotten used to spotting them on the ground and as small shrubs, but this one was so big that I hadn't even considered to consider.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Since my previous initiation experience with poison oak lasted for more than a month and was rather unpleasant, I've developed a flight reaction to this plant. However, when living outside it is difficult to flee (even if it's a plant, haha, well, to flee its oils that I already probably spread allover...). So I sat down for a tiny break and then started to dig out some old shirt and my last bits of water, splashed the fabric, and tried to rub off my skin on the legs and hands as thoroughly as possible. Which is not very much, in such a messy environment. But alas! Better try than not. I also changed clothes and dropped all the potentially invested stuff into a plastic bag. That's all I can do for now, we'll see whether the itchy bumps will come...
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					So the resting place was chosen where the deer rest, too. The smell of stable hangs in the air, but only very faintly and rather pleasant. I did, however, encounter two fleas, oh my!, and hope they won't find too much excitement about that bald mammal that'll share their spot tonight. I considered moving and went ahead, but eh... The deer chose their spot well and it seems to be the only one without inclination and poison oak. So I'll take the fleas and wash my stuff tomorrow.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Back to Pokémon: So after climbing into my sleeping bag I went to read on reddit a bit what has been going on - and a new update was released that people seemed to be actually pretty excited about! My internet is painstakingly slow for these kind of things, but I launched the download anyways. Who knows, maybe I'll be among the lucky ones that get to try out the tracker, yay!
					<br>So now I've been waiting for all those MB to find their way into my little phone and getting myself a bit excited about another change in the game mechanics. This truly is what I enjoy the most - that there are so many different ways that I have already been playing this game and it seems to be offering even more to come. It's very fluid at the monment, but also just allows different approaches through the way it is set up. Looking forward to seeing what this will bring. : )
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Oh dear! The update is actually finished... So let's see whether downloading it in Marin County at a deer layr in the middle of nowhere next to a street will reward me with a tryout-tracker...
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					<- Nope. : )
