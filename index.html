They all feel very nice and it's sweet to have some company, even if only remotley. Maybe the fact that it's remotely makes it even easier. Some wrote about interesting spawning grounds around the Bay, and I'll go ahead and sum up that information so I can adapt my route accordingly -></div>

                        <div class="card-body">My thoughts at the end of the first day are, that there are moments when it actually feels like a little Pokémon adventure travel. When I approached the Redwood City Harbor area this evening, biking on that long path, the sun setting on my left and the large buildings shining green, I did feel like I imagine feeling in the game, approaching a new City. And man: I made it. I biked from one city on my map to the next one ; ) Wasn't necessarily the plan, but hei! it's cool with me.</div>

                        <div class="card-body">Another thought is, that catching Pokémon doesn't work very well like that. I mean, completing the Pokédex, getting many, getting specific ones, etc. The whole catching business. Because it still takes pretty long to get from one place to another, it's still hard to find specific mons with the three-steps around and Pokévision simply not showing many or any.</div>

                        <div class="card-body">So, primarily, it is a travel. And only secondarily it is a travel to catch Pokémon. It is still very integrated, the whole Go experience. I have the app running all the time and I check frequently. I have those people I am chatting with, and we talk about Pokémon. And I try (but didn't manage well) to utilize these other apps, to try to pinpoint where one really is and maybe end up finding interesting ones.</div>

                        <div class="card-body">So I biked. The sun was sweet and set during the evening for a very long time. Some special flowers were in bloom that gave off a very distinct smell that lingered in the air, together with cut grass. It might have been wild fennel, but really tall plants. People were walking in bunches in the evening, around the park, together, small kids with bikes, couples, and people alone were running. I wonder how is it possible that Americans are fat - they have going for a walk outside so established as a together-activity! I passed by some people talking about hatching eggs, and I find it really beautiful how pervasive the game is. That is one reason why I wanted to go on this trip. To look around and see it popping up here and there. It's making a real difference in people's lives. Suddenly people walk. Someone told me that he walked 40 miles in the past week! A week ago or so I heard some people saying "Obama tries to do away with obesity, and then Pokémon Go comes out and it just solves within a few days..." It's obviously overdone, but it's not so far from the truth. I believe it is a very nice example of positive influence.</div>

                        <div class="card-body">Another thing I want to note, is that hatching works pretty well. Catching not really, but hatching does. I hatched today already 5 Pokémon on the first day of the trip. While most of them weren't too interesting, one was actually a Scyther. Yay! : ) I bike slowly, and the game counts my steps, or most of it at least. So eggies hatch. It's cool! Except that now I only have one incubator, so it'll slow down considerably. But okay. I have many more miles to roll!</div>

Or even how many. It feels as if there is this one foe, and you battle and try. Finally you win the gym, then you lose it again. And this can go over and over again.
But maybe it's a bunch of different people. Every time someone new. In the end it doesn't matter. You have this tiny competition going, and after all it's just about picking up those 10 gold coins every day. But hei: Today I got 20! Boosted two of my stronger Pokemon and took two gyms that were close to each other. Then be fast:
Collect.
Yay.</div>

It's still peculiar when coming from 6 months on the other side of those small hills, where fog never stays longer than until maybe 8 in the morning.</div>

I watched one of them pass along the coast from left to right. That took surprisingly long. It was calm, calmed me down. I enjoyed.</div>

It is probably useless, as I haven't yet established a good way of dealing with those moments I capture. But I do it still, something about life being fleeting, something about the wish to share, something about the wish to keep and remember.
But my thought today was, that once that initial craze has passed, then I am able to sit and calm down. It's a wave. And if the situation lasts long enough, and if I am consciously staying around in the situation for long enough, then I can also just sit and look... And that's just what I did.

Except for my computer, I feel like the most homeless person in the universe in this city. Seeing all these people in the streets makes me really sad. It’s pretty intense. I think my face dropped many centimeters from where I started this morning. It just all feels so messy and run down. Here are the two smells of San Francisco again: weed and homelessness. It really doesn’t make me happy to come here. There is this moment at the beginning when it does. It did again today, it did originally when I arrived the first time.
But the heavy of it all sinks in and weighs me down immensely. I'm not sure I would want to live here. Rather work from home on the countryside. Those hundreds of Pokéstops can’t make up for it, when I need to dive into my phone, autistically spinning them so that I don’t have to look around too much.</div>

It makes sense that kings built their stairways above the streets, so that they could walk to church without needing to go out on the street. Or that science-fiction-futures often show the scum dropping to the bottom (or below) the streets.
Strange strange strange.
Maybe that event tonight is gonna be enough SF for me on this journey. I’d definitely prefer fewer Pokémon if it means more joy in life...</div>

So, I've really arrived at the city. The big city on my map. It's not exactly pleasant. I feel out of place. There's a large amount of trainers around, I can see everyone walking down the pathways catching and training. The city is messy. Big, too, and it feels as if it makes life hectic and difficult. This is not the way my adventure goes. However, it fits in here well. It's a step on the way. The big city! It is loud, people are training (but are they really?). A Pokémon trainer on a big adventure has to pass by these kinds of places. Because the city-fame and elusive pleasures is not what he set out for. There's something else that is calling, and that something is adventure. ;)</div>

I needed a time-out but I will return soon, not sure how long I'll stay. The big events are not my scene, but I really wanted to see what is going on and how do people play here. It's impressive how massive the game is. At times it feels that everyone is playing. Families do, couples do, groups of friends do, and some even play alone. It seems to appeal to everyone, and cover many areas of society. I felt it was big back where I came from, but this is still surprising for me. Big cities, many people. I wonder how it looks like in other countries, how it looks like at home. Because today I realized that I am attributing this craze to here, as if it was a cultural phenomenon of the US - but it isn't at all. Globalization has swept across years ago, so a trend so big is never contained to one country. The changes I experience are changes worldwide, probably, and I just feel them so specific to this area, because this is where I was when the changes hit.</div>

I did. : )

Finally I went to check all the IVs of all the ones that I kept, in order to determine which ones to keep and which ones to evolve further. It was a ride! I worked on my system of taking notes and how to adapt the SilphRoad IV tool to give me good results. Here's the essential takeaway:</div>

                        <div class="card-body">(personally, currently) CONFIRMED: CP does not really matter. If you're into long-term gains, then the IVs are important. You can always level up the CP of a Pokémon with Stardust and Candy (sure, some catching needs to be done for that). But you can't change the IVs. So once the Pokémon will max out, you will be left off with a better one if you chose one with great IVs.</div>

                        <div class="card-body">There's an imprecision factor in trying to determine the IVs. That factor is the level of the Pokémon, that needs to be set through adjusting a slider on an arc (just like in the game). However, it is difficult to get the exact right position for the slider, since the amount of Stardust, that can be used to double-check, is usually accurate for more than only one level. In some Pokémon and some level ranges, this potential span of differences can be very large, so that e.g. a Magikarp could be between 37% and 54% total above average. This makes a huge difference.</div>

Families do, friends go, it's really much more a thing than in other countries. Even if this also brings a weird bunch of people into the woods, and even if nature appreciation doesn't go much farther than walking the smallest loop. It's still more than other folks come up with! I wonder how one can become fat when movement is such a natural part of one's culture.</div>

I do prefer the silence. Now I finally remove the earplugs and listen to the sounds of the woods instead of my pumping heartbeat. I climb up higher onto the nearby hills, dedicated to take a small hiking tour all around Muir Woods and also the coast. I can feel that I didn't sleep much the night before.</div>

Checking the grid I can see which mons I'll be encountering on the way. I walk forward. At some point my phone buzzes and I know who'll be there - and indeed! It's that Pidgey I saw on the radar before. It's fun - and again very different than before. There's no searching, it's simply an early warning system, and you walk on confident that it'll buzz up sooner or later.</div>

One thing I kept remembering from a story that a person told me about their encounter with a mountain lion, was to better not rest on the path of an animal... So I looked around, here, and there a bit deeper... until I figured in cold sweat that the bush I'd been considering to dive into was my old nemesis Poison Oak! A HUGE poison oak! I had gotten used to spotting them on the ground and as small shrubs, but this one was so big that I hadn't even considered to consider.</div>

                        <div class="card-body">Because my previous initiation experience with poison oak lasted for more than a month and was rather unpleasant, I've developed a flight reaction to this plant. However, when living outside it is difficult to flee (even if it's a plant, haha, well... It's difficult to flee its oils that I have probably spread allover already...). So I sat down for a tiny break and then started to dig out some old shirt and my last bits of water, splashed the fabric, and tried to rub the invisible oils off my skin on the legs and hands as thoroughly as possible. Which is not very thoroughly, in such a messy environment. But alas! Better try than not. I also changed clothes and dropped all the potentially infested stuff into a plastic bag. That's all I can do for now, we'll see whether the itchy bumps will return...</div>

I did, however, encounter two fleas, oh my! and hope they won't find too much excitement about that bald mammal that'll share their spot tonight. I considered moving and went ahead, but eh... The deer chose their spot well and it seems to be the only one without steep inclination or poison oak. So I'll take the flea spot and wash my stuff tomorrow.</div>

This truly is what I enjoy the most - that there are so many different ways that I have already been playing this game and it seems to be offering more to come. It's very fluid at the moment and still changes, but also allows different approaches through the way it is set up. Looking forward to seeing what this new tracker might bring. : )</div>

Today I wanted to go to Beach Chalet and catch some rare ones, but only walking for two blocks made me feel rather done with it all. So I ended up turning around and going back to relax some more.

While he was biking around the park to try it out, a Gastly appeared kind of close by. So I was wondering whether to go and get it... but felt bad for if he came back and I wasn't there. After a while I crossed the street, but turned around right away. The pull... but then still the decency to hold the spot. Of course Gastly was gone after the meeting was over!</div>

I wonder whether I'll ever come back and for what reason would I do so. I learned to like the city a bit. Surprised, I have to admit that I learned to like it quite some.
Well... good night San Francisco. Sleep well crazy stressed stupid smart innovative driven city.</div>

While I am inclined to evolve the 96% one, Dratinis are very rare and will probably be even less common in the rural areas I am going to. So I <a href="http://pogotoolkit.com/" target=="_blank">checked what CP to expect</a> and I <a href="https://buimichael.github.io/pokemongo-Stardust-Calculator/" target=="_blank">checked how much Candy (and Stardust) I'll need</a>.

I'll pop these values into a table and then take my decisions.</div>

I walked around all over campus and did gym battles. I actually placed one mon in each of the ~7 gyms that were in my general area of action at campus. Not all at the same time though, and I was soon lacking potions. I picked my rewards when I had 3 Pokémon assigned, but at one time later I managed to get up to having 5 assigned to gyms simulatneously! That was my record so far. And also picking 30 coins in one day is a record for me. So this went nicely!</div>
