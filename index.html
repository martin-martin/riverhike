			<h3>Day 1 - Palo Alto to Redwood City</h3>
			<section class="thoughts">
				<p class="note">
					I'm sitting next to the wide salt marshes off Redwood City, behind some oleander bushes that separate me from the road. It's night, both on my phone as well as outside, and I decided to try to record a bit my thoughts and experiences on this pokétravel.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					First of all: It's quite fun! :) I'm just going on a bike ride, but there's this additional level to it, some small task that is constantly there if I want to have it. If I don't want to, and rather just look at the passing landscape, it's pretty easy to turn it off.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I started late, because the GoPro I bought through craigslist a few days ago was making troubles. I'm not too lucky with the action cameras so far... I read up on the issue and realized it might be related to a bad SD card. After a short down time that had followed my excitement of "starting early in the morning", and earning $55 online as a distraction, I decided to start anyways.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					My first stop brought me to Fry's Electronics, a huge store in Palo Alto that sells all sorts of electronic equipment. I decided to go get a proper SD card and assume that the camera was fine and didnt freeze because of bigger problems. Got one after careful consideration, and even a 53Cents iPhone 4 screen protector for my iPhone 5C. It snugly fits, leaving the top free and framing the time with the loudspeaker cutout : )
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					So what's there to say. Mostly it's not too interesting to read these journals afterwards, or for someone else, so I'll try to think about what were the interesting things for me, actually.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Recently I found out why thee are these people sitting all day (and night) at the train crossings... <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/12/the-silicon-valley-suicides/413140/"><strong>Suicides...</strong></a>
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I enjoy being part of the Pokémon Go whatsapp group of those SF people. They all feel very nice and it's sweet to have some company, even if only remotley like that. Maybe that's also easier, to have it only remotely like that. They've also already told me quite a lot about interesting spawning grounds, and I'll go ahead and collect that information so I can adapt my route accordingly.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					INSERT THE PLACES INTO A LIST OR SUCH
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					My thoughts at the end of the first day are, that there are moments when it actually feels like a little Pokémon adventure travel. When I approached the Redwood City Harbor area this evening, biking on that long path, the sun setting on my left and the large buildings shining green, I did feel like I imagine feeling in the game, approaching a new City.
					And man: I made it. I biked from one city on my map to the next one ; ) Wasn't necessarily the plan, but hei! it's cool with me.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Another thought is, that catching Pokémon doesn't work very well like that. I mean, completing the Pokédex, getting many, getting specific ones, etc. The whole catching business. Because it still takes pretty long to get from one place to another, it's still hard to find specific mons with the three-steps around and Pokévision simply not showing many or any (CHARMANDER PIC).
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					So, primarily, it is a <strong>travel</strong>. And only secondarily it is a travel to catch Pokémon. It is still very integrated, the whole Go experience. I have the app running all the time and I check frequently. I have those people I am chatting with, and we talk about Pokémon. And I try (but didn't manage well) to utilize these other apps, to try to pinpoint where one really is and maybe end up finding interesting ones.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					So I biked. The sun was sweet and set during the evening for a very long time.
					Some special flowers were in bloom that gave off a very distinct smell that lingered in the air, together with cut grass. It might have been wild fennel, but really tall plants. People were walking in bunches in the evening, around the park, together, small kids with bikes, couples, and people alone were running. I wonder how is it possible that Americans are fat - they have going for a walk outside so established as a together-activity! I passed by some people talking about hatching eggs, and I find it really beautiful how pervasive the game is. That is one reason why I wanted to go on this trip. To look around and see it popping up here and there. It's making a real difference in people's lives. Suddenly people walk. One guy in the whatsapp group wrote today that he walked 40 miles in the past week.
					A week ago or so I heard some people saying "Obama tries to do away with obesity, and then Pokémon Go comes out and it just solves within a few days..." It's obviously overdone, but it's not so far from the truth. I believe it is a very nice example of positive influence.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Also the groups formed, young kids together with their friends together with their older brother and their friends. Little groups walking around together catching Pokémon. Outside. Awesome!
					And families together. Parents playing with their kids.
					And couples taking walks. And also people alone. Middle aged men, women, young boys in two, girl groups... everyone is playing! It's quite impressive, it is.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Okay, just some thoughts...
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Another thing I want to note, is that hatching works pretty well. Catching not really, but hatching does. I hatched today already 5 Pokémon on the first day of the trip. While most of them weren't too interesting, one was actually a Scyther. Yay! : )
					I bike slowly, and the game counts my steps, or most of it at least. So eggies hatch. It's cool! Except that now I only have one incubator, so it'll slow down considerably.
					But okay. I have many more miles to roll!
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Day 1. Pretty views. An Evee at the Oval. A Slowbro around Facebook. The smell of wild Fennel. White crusts on the salt marshes. Normal outdoor Americans. The road to Redwood City Harbor. My sitting spot my sleeping spot. A skunk that just walks by. Planes flying, sky graying, trains honking, loading stones. Me here, finally out. Finally moving, and on the road again. My bike my helmet my sleeping bag and me.
					Time to say good night.
					Good night. : )

			<h3>Day 2 - Redwood City ~~~ Pacifica</h3>
			<img class="banner" src="img/RC_morning.jpg">
			<section class="thoughts">
				<p class="note">
					Started to experience that it can be quite fun to gym-battle against someone. You don't usually know who it is. Or if it's the same person. Or even how many. It feels as if there is this one foe, and you battle and try. Finally you win the gym, then you lose it again. And this can go over and over again. <br>But maybe it's a bunch of different people. Every time someone new. In the end it doesn't matter. You have this tiny competition going, and after all it's just about picking up those 10 gold coins every day. But hei: Today I got 20! Boosted two of my stronger Pokemon and took two gyms that were close to each other. Then be fast: <br>Collect. <br>Yay.
				</p>
				<img class="note" src="img/two_gyms.jpg">
				<p class="note">
					There's this thing about Pokémon, that was also in a way present in the Gamboy games - that there are these few strong ones that it makes sense to have and train (or feed, in the GO case), and therefore it ends up being a rather boring selection of always the same Pokémon hovering around the gym towers.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Today I also started using the Pokéradar - in order to then walk and look for a specific mon. It was fun! I got a Kabuto like that, and the funnest part was pedaliung fast towards a Kingler... I knew my chances to be there on time were slim, and indeed it had vanished before I arrived. Hm... I was thinking that this travel is so far a very slow one, and maybe it <strong>is</strong> actually a Pokémon travel : )
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I had an intense battle with a Butterfree in front of the Oracle fountain (and the hovering Katamaran). Butterfree had 500something CP and was very stubborn about going to live inside a ball. I offered him loads of them. Different ones. Re-white ones, blue-red ones, and even quite a bunch of black-yellow ones! He checked a few of them out from the inside, but declined every time. In the end I ran out of offers and he just disappeard. Belly full of Razzberries. Butterfree! Ah! There is no such thing as free Butter.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					A stopover in a Starbucks brought me to witness the little circle of old men meeting there. Wehen one plus arrived I tried to make space, and so we got to talk ab it. Turns out three of five spoke German, and before I left I got a Starbucks gift card from one of the men... Very nice! "
					So that you remember this place". It works : )
				</p>
				<img class="note" src="">
				<p class="note">
					Up on one Vista Point.
					<br>San Francisco in the distance.
					<br>I trained one Pidgeot-held gym up to Lv 3. Maybe I'll also assign a mon before I go. Does this count? We'll see.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					It's funny how I expect everyone to be playing too. A guy in a white car looked at me suspiciously, and me I thought "aha!".
					<br>A little later I saw him inhaling drugs from a balloon.
					<br>I guess not everyone is actually playing. : /
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Another thing about this place, and I feel like generalizing this to "US-Americans", is that people enjoy their Vista Points from within their cars.
					<br>Come, park, watch, (inhale,) drive forward.
					<br>There were more people here in the time since I arrived, only two older ladies ever left their car.
					They went to the bench and the younger helped the older one light a cigarette.
					<br>Inhale.
					<br>Drive forward.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					I also went astray. Up towards the reservoirs, and back down without ever getting there. Haha, didn't take care for directions and ended up doing a hilly-loop drive. But it was good and completely worth it!
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Worth it because I found the Guittard chocolate factroy in Milbrae. Found it in the best possible way: I smelled the chocolate being made, I tasted it from the air! I love when such good smells linger in the air, and it makes me unsure where the borders between tasting and smelling lie.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Guittard chocolate factory does, so I found out, not sell chunks of broken chocolate at the factory. I guess it all goes to MilkPail... But the ladies were very friendly and when she asked me what darkness of chocolate I like, I realized that I'll be lucky and won't be leaving with empty hands after all : )
					<br>I like it dark.
				</p>
				<img clas="note" src="">
				<p class="note">
					Cute! Some old roads, from when i first arrived... A same view, but coming from the other side. I biked up to the second reservoir.
					<br>Memories of getting my first Clif bar as a present from a friendly ranger :D
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					It was pretty intense to see how the world suddenly plunged from hot and dry and sunny, into cold and wet and foggy. Without much movement or time change. The clouds I would often see plunging across the hills towards the Bay in the evening. Today I was within them. Winds blow strongly, an unknown wetness sweeps through your hair, and the sunshine hides away behind layers of suspended waterdrops.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Pacifica made me dress up all those clothes I thought I'd never need again...
